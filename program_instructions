# genetic code ... a sequence of nitrogenous base pairs, A, U, G, C, T
# initialize a hash of base pairs
# define the genetic code
# define rule of replication, as well as complementary base pairing
# randomize hash of base pairs x times and initialize x new arrays
# print/synthesize complementary pairs of hash and store in an array
# sequence through each array and find matching product
# chain product to get protein
